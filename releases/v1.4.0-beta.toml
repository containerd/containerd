preface = """\
The fifth major release of containerd includes a mix of new features and
expanded support, such as support for CGroups v2, expanded SELinux support,
support for Windows on Kubernetes through CRI, and support for snapshotters
based on shared remote storage. All significant bug and stability fixes included
in this release are also available on supported prior releases. Like previous
major releases, what is not included in this release is also important. There
are only two small additions to the API with no backwards incompatible changes,
allowing client and daemon upgrades to be done independently without disruption.
The incredible increase in usage of containerd over the last year has shown the
value of our core principles to easily expand support for different use cases
while driving toward ever increasing stability.
