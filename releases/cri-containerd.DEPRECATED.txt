The "cri-containerd-(cni-)-VERSION-OS-ARCH.tar.gz" release bundle has been deprecated since containerd 1.6,
does not work on some Linux distributions, and will be removed in containerd 2.0.

Instead of this, install the following components separately, either from the binary or from the source:
* containerd:  https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases
* runc:        https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases
* CNI plugins: https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases

The CRI plugin has been included in containerd since containerd 1.1.
