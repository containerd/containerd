The first major release of containerd 2.x focuses on the continued stability of
containerd's core feature set with an easy upgrade from containerd 1.x. This
release includes the stabilization of new features added in the last 1.x release
as well as the removal of features which were deprecated in 1.x. The goal is to
support the vast community of containerd users well into the future along with
their ever increasing deployment footprints and variety of use cases.

### Which file should I download?
* `containerd-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:         âœ…Recommended. Dynamically linked with glibc 2.31 (Ubuntu 20.04).
* `containerd-static-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:  Statically linked. Expected to be used on non-glibc Linux distributions. Not position-independent.

In addition to containerd, typically you will have to install [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases)
and [CNI plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases) from their official sites too.

See also the [Getting Started](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) documentation.
