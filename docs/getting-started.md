# Getting started with containerd

There are many different ways to use containerd.
If you are a developer working on containerd you can use the `ctr` tool to quickly test features and functionality without writing extra code.
However, if you want to integrate containerd into your project we have an easy to use client package that allows you to work with containerd.

In this guide we will pull and run a redis server with containerd using the client package.
We will assume that you are running a modern linux host for this example with a compatible build of `runc`.
Please refer to [RUNC.md](/RUNC.md) for the currently supported version of `runc`.
This project requires Go 1.9.x or above.
If you need to install Go or update your currently installed one, please refer to Go install page at https://golang.org/doc/install.

## Starting containerd

You can download one of the latest builds for containerd on the [github releases](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases) page and then use your favorite process supervisor to get the daemon started.
If you are using systemd, we have a `containerd.service` file at the root of the repository that you can use.

The daemon also uses a configuration file located in `/etc/containerd/config.toml` for specifying daemon level options.
A sample configuration file looks like this:

```toml
oom_score = -999

[debug]
        level = "debug"

[metrics]
        address = "127.0.0.1:1338"

[plugins.linux]
        runtime = "runc"
        shim_debug = true
```

The default configuration can be generated via `containerd config default > /etc/containerd/config.toml`.

## Connecting to containerd

We will start a new `main.go` file and import the containerd root package that contains the client.


```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/containerd/containerd"
)

func main() {
	if err := redisExample(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

func redisExample() error {
	client, err := containerd.New("/run/containerd/containerd.sock")
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer client.Close()
	return nil
}
```

This will create a new client with the default containerd socket path.
Because we are working with a daemon over GRPC we need to create a `context` for use with calls to client methods.
containerd is also namespaced for callers of the API.
We should also set a namespace for our guide after creating the context.

```go
	ctx := namespaces.WithNamespace(context.Background(), "example")
```

Having a namespace for our usage ensures that containers, images, and other resources without containerd do not conflict with other users of a single daemon.

## Pulling the redis image

Now that we have a client to work with we need to pull an image.
We can use the redis image based on Alpine Linux from the DockerHub.

```go
	image, err := client.Pull(ctx, "docker.io/library/redis:alpine", containerd.WithPullUnpack)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
```

The containerd client uses the `Opts` pattern for many of the method calls.
We use the `containerd.WithPullUnpack` so that we not only fetch and download the content into containerd's content store but also unpack it into a snapshotter for use as a root filesystem.

Let's put the code together that will pull the redis image based on alpine linux from Dockerhub and then print the name of the image on the console's output.

```go
package main

import (
        "context"
        "log"

        "github.com/containerd/containerd"
        "github.com/containerd/containerd/namespaces"
)

func main() {
        if err := redisExample(); err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }
}

func redisExample() error {
        client, err := containerd.New("/run/containerd/containerd.sock")
        if err != nil {
                return err
        }
        defer client.Close()

        ctx := namespaces.WithNamespace(context.Background(), "example")
        image, err := client.Pull(ctx, "docker.io/library/redis:alpine", containerd.WithPullUnpack)
        if err != nil {
                return err
        }
        log.Printf("Successfully pulled %s image\n", image.Name())

        return nil
}
```

```bash
> go build main.go
> sudo ./main

2017/08/13 17:43:21 Successfully pulled docker.io/library/redis:alpine image
```

## Creating an OCI Spec and Container

Now that we have an image to base our container off of, we need to generate an OCI runtime specification that the container can be based off of as well as the new container.

containerd provides reasonable defaults for generating OCI runtime specs.
There is also an `Opt` for modifying the default config based on the image that we pulled.

The container will be based off of the image, use the runtime information in the spec that was just created, and we will allocate a new read-write snapshot so the container can store any persistent information.

```go
	container, err := client.NewContainer(
		ctx,
		"redis-server",
		containerd.WithNewSnapshot("redis-server-snapshot", image),
		containerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image)),
	)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer container.Delete(ctx, containerd.WithSnapshotCleanup)
```

If you have an existing OCI specification created you can use `containerd.WithSpec(spec)` to set it on the container.

When creating a new snapshot for the container we need to provide a snapshot ID as well as the Image that the container will be based on.
By providing a separate snapshot ID than the container ID we can easily reuse, existing snapshots across different containers.

We also add a line to delete the container along with its snapshot after we are done with this example.

Here is example code to pull the redis image based on alpine linux from Dockerhub, create an OCI spec, create a container based on the spec and finally delete the container.
```go
package main

import (
        "context"
        "log"

        "github.com/containerd/containerd"
        "github.com/containerd/containerd/oci"
        "github.com/containerd/containerd/namespaces"
)

func main() {
        if err := redisExample(); err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }
}

func redisExample() error {
        client, err := containerd.New("/run/containerd/containerd.sock")
        if err != nil {
                return err
        }
        defer client.Close()

        ctx := namespaces.WithNamespace(context.Background(), "example")
        image, err := client.Pull(ctx, "docker.io/library/redis:alpine", containerd.WithPullUnpack)
        if err != nil {
                return err
        }
        log.Printf("Successfully pulled %s image\n", image.Name())

        container, err := client.NewContainer(
                ctx,
                "redis-server",
                containerd.WithNewSnapshot("redis-server-snapshot", image),
                containerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image)),
        )
        if err != nil {
                return err
        }
        defer container.Delete(ctx, containerd.WithSnapshotCleanup)
        log.Printf("Successfully created container with ID %s and snapshot with ID redis-server-snapshot", container.ID())

        return nil
}
```

Let's see it in action.

```bash
> go build main.go
> sudo ./main

2017/08/13 18:01:35 Successfully pulled docker.io/library/redis:alpine image
2017/08/13 18:01:35 Successfully created container with ID redis-server and snapshot with ID redis-server-snapshot
```

## Creating a running Task

One thing that may be confusing at first for new containerd users is the separation between a `Container` and a `Task`.
A container is a metadata object that resources are allocated and attached to.
A task is a live, running process on the system.
Tasks should be deleted after each run while a container can be used, updated, and queried multiple times.

```go
	task, err := container.NewTask(ctx, cio.NewCreator(cio.WithStdio))
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer task.Delete(ctx)
```

The new task that we just created is actually a running process on your system.
We use `cio.WithStdio` so that all IO from the container is sent to our `main.go` process.
This is a `cio.Opt` that configures the `Streams` used by `NewCreator` to return a `cio.IO`
for the new task.

If you are familiar with the OCI runtime actions, the task is currently in the "created" state.
This means that the namespaces, root filesystem, and various container level settings have been initialized but the user defined process, in this example "redis-server", has not been started.
This gives users a chance to setup network interfaces or attach different tools to monitor the container.
containerd also takes this opportunity to monitor your container as well.
Waiting on things like the container's exit status and cgroup metrics are setup at this point.

If you are familiar with prometheus you can curl the containerd metrics endpoint (in the `config.toml` that we created) to see your container's metrics:

```bash
> curl 127.0.0.1:1338/v1/metrics
```

Pretty cool right?

## Task Wait and Start

Now that we have a task in the created state we need to make sure that we wait on the task to exit.
It is essential to wait for the task to finish so that we can close our example and cleanup the resources that we created.
You always want to make sure you `Wait` before calling `Start` on a task.
This makes sure that you do not encounter any races if the task has a simple program like `/bin/true` that exits promptly after calling start.

```go
	exitStatusC, err := task.Wait(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	if err := task.Start(ctx); err != nil {
		return err
	}
```

Now we should see the `redis-server` logs in our terminal when we run the `main.go` file.

## Killing the task

Since we are running a long running server we will need to kill the task in order to exit out of our example.
To do this we will simply call `Kill` on the task after waiting a couple of seconds so we have a chance to see the redis-server logs.

```go
	time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)

	if err := task.Kill(ctx, syscall.SIGTERM); err != nil {
		return err
	}

	status := <-exitStatusC
	code, exitedAt, err := status.Result()
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	fmt.Printf("redis-server exited with status: %d\n", code)
```

We wait on our exit status channel that we setup to ensure the task has fully exited and we get the exit status.
If you have to reload containers or miss waiting on a task, `Delete` will also return the exit status when you finally delete the task.
We got you covered.

```go
status, err := task.Delete(ctx)
```

## Full Example

Here is the full example that we just put together.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"syscall"
	"time"

	"github.com/containerd/containerd"
	"github.com/containerd/containerd/cio"
	"github.com/containerd/containerd/oci"
	"github.com/containerd/containerd/namespaces"
)

func main() {
	if err := redisExample(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

func redisExample() error {
	// create a new client connected to the default socket path for containerd
	client, err := containerd.New("/run/containerd/containerd.sock")
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer client.Close()

	// create a new context with an "example" namespace
	ctx := namespaces.WithNamespace(context.Background(), "example")

	// pull the redis image from DockerHub
	image, err := client.Pull(ctx, "docker.io/library/redis:alpine", containerd.WithPullUnpack)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// create a container
	container, err := client.NewContainer(
		ctx,
		"redis-server",
		containerd.WithImage(image),
		containerd.WithNewSnapshot("redis-server-snapshot", image),
		containerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image)),
	)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer container.Delete(ctx, containerd.WithSnapshotCleanup)

	// create a task from the container
	task, err := container.NewTask(ctx, cio.NewCreator(cio.WithStdio))
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer task.Delete(ctx)

	// make sure we wait before calling start
	exitStatusC, err := task.Wait(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}

	// call start on the task to execute the redis server
	if err := task.Start(ctx); err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// sleep for a lil bit to see the logs
	time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)

	// kill the process and get the exit status
	if err := task.Kill(ctx, syscall.SIGTERM); err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// wait for the process to fully exit and print out the exit status

	status := <-exitStatusC
	code, _, err := status.Result()
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	fmt.Printf("redis-server exited with status: %d\n", code)

	return nil
}
```

We can build this example and run it as follows to see our hard work come together.

```bash
> go build main.go
> sudo ./main

In the end, we really did not write that much code when you use the client package.
