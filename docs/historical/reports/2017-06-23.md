# Development Report for June 23, 2017

## Events Service

We added an events service for getting events across various services including
containers, content, execution, images, namespaces, and snapshots. Additionally
we added `ctr events` to view events emitted by the service.

```

## Filters

We added the syntax to use for filtration of items over the containerd API. The
`filter` package defines a syntax and parser that can be used across types and
use cases in a uniform manner. This will be used commonly across the API for
images, containers, events, snapshots, etc.

The syntax is fairly familiar, if you've used container ecosystem
projects.  At the core, we base it on the concept of protobuf field
paths, augmenting with the ability to quote portions of the field path
to match arbitrary labels. These "selectors" come in the following
syntax:

```
<fieldpath>[<operator><value>]
```

A basic example is as follows:

```
name==foo
```

This would match all objects that have a field `name` with the value
`foo`. If we only want to test if the field is present, we can omit the
operator. This is most useful for matching labels in containerd. The
following will match objects that has the field labels and have the
label "foo" defined:

```
labels.foo
```

We also allow for quoting of parts of the field path to allow matching
of arbitrary items:

```
labels."very complex label"==something
```

We also define `!=` and `~=` as operators. The `!=` operator will match
all objects that don't match the value for a field and `~=` will compile
the target value as a regular expression and match the field value
against that.

Selectors can be combined using a comma, such that the resulting
selector will require all selectors are matched for the object to match.
The following example will match objects that are named `foo` and have
the label `bar`:

```
name==foo,labels.bar
```

[#1050: Container list filters](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/1050)

[#1069: Event filters](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/1069)

## Support for pushing and pulling OCI indexes

We added support for pushing and pulling OCI indexes. Currently all content
referenced by the list are pulled and further work on the client will be done
to allow selection of the pulled manifest to extract and run.

[#1022: Support pull for OCI indexes](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/1022)

## Snapshot list

We added `ctr snapshot list` to snapshots from containerd. This will output all
snapshots, not just the active snapshots used by containers.

```
$ ctr snapshot list
ID                                                                      Parent                                                                  State     Readonly

## Containerd notes from Moby Summit

At the Moby summit on 06/19/2017 there was a containerd round table meeting.
This was a good opportunity to discuss the upcoming API freeze and release of
containerd with others working with it in the community. Always remember that
these summit round tables are not the only opportunity to have these topics
discussed and everyone is encouraged to open issues and engage the community on
Slack.

* "What are the plans for a resolver-resolver and image reference namespacing?"
    - Maintainers are trying to figure out what everyoneâ€™s plans/needs are for a resolver-resolver.
    - A resolver-resolver allows configuring where push/pull happens. Could take in a configuration format which specifies how to push, pull, and authenticate. Needed in order to do discover of names to registry configurations.
    - Stephen confirms we are thinking of more configuration driven rather programmatic. The resolver-resolver and any configuration is always client side, allowing the integrator to design any interface or configuration suits their needs. But we are also looking to define something that could be consistently applied by containerd clients.
    - The resolver-resolver will be compatible with Docker, but could allow Docker to expand its resolution support.

* "What is the plan for garbage collection?"
    - Current design is oriented around being garbage collected. The data model is designed around references which are used to walk a root set. Everything unreferenced would be garbage collected.
    - Another more complicated aspect of garbage collection is around policy, allowing to clean up resources based on age or client specified policies.
    - Client side implementations would allow establishing policies.
    - Containerd will require a stop the world to do the garbage collection.
    - A heavy delete which does not garbage collect is an option and similar to to the interface today. The API does not guarantee that disk is cleaned up after a deletion, only that the resource is freed. Inline deletion would require reference counting to know when to delete. This would also require global locking to protect the references.
    - How to handle content which is active but unreferenced, leasing vs pre-allocate. This has not been decided on.

* "What will need to change in Docker in regards to graphdrivers for accommodating the containerd snapshotters?"
    - The goal is to have graphdrivers be able to be used as snapshot drivers.
    - To accomplish this graphdrivers need to be able to return mounts without needing to require action on unmount. Unmount will no longer contact the graphdriver since snapshotters to do not control the mount/unmount lifecycle.
    - For implementation, in the repository tree only overlayfs and btrfs are supported. Everything else will be out of tree and require special builds or proxying.

* "Version numbers on events and API objects"
    - Are objects mutable? Some objects are mutable but not necessarily relevant to clients.
    - Are containers mutable? It can have multiple tasks, can be started and stopped.
    - We may need to have task id separate from the container to differentiate between tasks within a container.
    - Tasks have a pid which could be used to identify the task. Someone had a customer that ran out of memory from running too many tasks, could be caused by repeated execs in the same container.
    - Getting state of a containers task involves requesting containers and tasks, or just tasks could be listed.
    - What are the API costs, is there measurements of the cost of API calls and comparisons with Docker? Calling docker ps can be expensive due to locks, containerd should be much cheaper and faster to call. This need to be verified and measurements added.

* "How can clients understand the capabilities of the containerd instance it is talking to?"
    - As an orchestrator, interested in understanding what can be done with the plugins. Example, docker log drivers change feature set but the log driver names do not change. Stuck on checking docker version.
    - There have been problems in the past with requiring multiple clients of docker to handle changes.
    - GRPC is adding introspection, plan is to wait for this work rather than making something ourselves.
    - The maintainers would like to understand what were the really bad changes in Docker that caused problems with version support for users. Problems around needing to bump the whole API to get a new feature. Containerd API versions each service and v1 interface will be stable and supported.
