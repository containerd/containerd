# Dockercon 2017 Summit

This year at Dockercon US 2017 we will be having a containerd Summit on Thursday morning the week of the conference.  

We are going to change the format slightly compared to the previous summit that was held in February.  We will be allocating more time to the breakout sessions and less time to static talks.  However, the group will be much larger than the previous summit so this document serves as a way to add discussion points for the breakout sessions. 

If you would like to add a discussion point to the agenda, submit a PR adding it to the list below.  A simple one line sentence is enough or expand if needed. 

If you have not signed up to attend the summit you can do so in this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNkLm984ABbFChPh02uJR2lJ6y1AXjFaDITCaxTFL-sHhPwQ/viewform).
