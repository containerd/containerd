The containerd managed opt directory provides a way for users to install containerd dependencies using the existing distribution infrastructure.

With runtime v2 and new shim's being built, it is a challenge to
download various shims or runtime dependencies onto a machine.

The managed `/opt` directory for containerd allows users to create images that provide these dependencies and install them on a system using the containerd client API.

Configuration:

*default:* `/opt/containerd`

*containerd config:*
```toml
[plugins.opt]
	path = "/opt/mypath"

```

Usage:

*code:*

```go
image, err := client.Pull(ctx, "docker.io/crosbymichael/runc:latest")
client.Install(ctx, image)
```

Options:

```go
// WithInstallLibs installs libs from the image
func WithInstallLibs(c *InstallConfig) {
}

// WithInstallReplace will replace existing files
func WithInstallReplace(c *InstallConfig) {
}
```

*ctr:*

```bash
ctr content fetch docker.io/crosbymichael/runc:latest
ctr install docker.io/crosbymichael/runc:latest
```

You can manage versions and see what is running via standard image commands.

Images:

These images MUST be small and only contain binaries and libs if required.

```Dockerfile
FROM scratch
Add runc /bin/runc
```

Containerd will only extract files in `/bin` of the image by default, Opts can be added to replace or install `libs/`.
However, we recommend that these binaries be static to reduce linked dependencies.

The code adds a service to manage an `/opt/containerd` directory and
provide that path to callers via the introspection service.

How to Test:

Delete runc from your system.

```bash
> sudo ctr run --rm  docker.io/library/redis:alpine redis
ctr: OCI runtime create failed: unable to retrieve OCI runtime error (open /run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v1.linux/default/redis/log.json: no such file or directory): exec: "runc": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown

For Windows:

```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809
ADD runhcs.exe /bin/runhcs.exe
```

```powershell
> ctr content fetch docker.io/ameyagawde/runhcs:1809 #An example image, not supported by containerd
> ctr install docker.io/ameyagawde/runhcs:1809
```
The Windows equivalent for `/opt/containerd` will be `$env:ProgramData\containerd\root\opt`
